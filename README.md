A Fast and Robust MLOps Swiss-Army Knife in Rust


## When to use xvc?

- Machine Learning Engineers: When you manage large quantities of *unstructured* data, like images, documents, audio files. When you create data pipelines on top of this data and want to run these pipelines when the data, code or other dependencies change. 
- Data Engineers: When you want to version data files, and want to track versions across datasets. When you have to provide this data in multiple remote locations, like S3 or local files. 
- Data Scientists: When you want to track which subset of the data you're working with, and how it changes by your operations. 
- Software Engineers: When you have binary artifacts that you use as dependencies and would like to have a `make` alternative that considers *content changes* rather than timestamps. 
- Everyone: When you have photo, audio, document files to backup on Git, but don't want to copy that huge data to all Git clones. When you want to run a command when any member of these files change. 

## What is xvc for?

- (for x = files) Track large files on Git, store them on the cloud, retrieve when necessary, label
   and query for subsets 
- (for x = pipelines) Define and run data -> model pipelines whose dependencies may be files,
   hyperparameters, regex searches, arbitrary URLs and more.
- (for x = experiments) Run isolated experiments, share them and store them in Git when necessary (TODO)
- (for x = data) Annotate data with arbitrary JSON and run queries and retrieve subsets of it.  (TODO)
- (for x = models) Associate models with datasets, metadata and features, then track, store, and deploy them (TODO)

## Installation

You can get the binary files for Linux, macOS and Windows from [releases] page. Copy the file to your path. 

Alternatively, if you have Rust [installed], you can build xvc: 

```shell
$ cargo install xvc
```

## Quick Start

Xvc tracks your files and directories on top of Git. To start run the following command in the repository.

```shell
$ xvc init
```

It initializes the metafiles in `.xvc/` directory and adds `.xvcignore` file in case you want to hide certain elements from Xvc. 

Add your data files and directories for tracking.

```shell
$ xvc file track my-data/
$ git add .xvc
$ git commit -m "Began to track my-data/ with Xvc"
$ git push
```

The command calculates data content hashes (with BLAKE-3, by default) and records them. 
It also copies files to content addressed directories under `.xvc/b3`

Define a file storage to share the files you added.

```shell
$ xvc remote new s3 --name my-remote --region us-east-1 --bucket-name my-xvc-remote
```

You can push the files you added to this remote.

```shell
$ xvc file push --to my-remote
```

You can now delete the files. 


```shell
$ rm -r my-data/
```

When you want to access this data later, you can clone the repository and get back the files from file storage. 

```shell
$ xvc file pull my-data/
```

If you have commands that depend on data or code elements, create a pipeline. 

```shell
$ xvc pipeline new --name update-data
```

Then define a step in this pipeline to depend on other files.

```shell
$ xvc pipeline step new --name my-data-update --command 'python3 preprocess.py' 
$ xvc pipeline step dependency --step my-data-update --files my-data/ --files preprocess.py
$ xvc pipeline step dependency --step my-data-update --regex 'names.txt:/^Name:'
$ xvc pipeline step dependency --step my-data-update --lines a-long-file.csv::-1000
$ xvc pipeline step output --step-name my-data-update --output-file preprocessed-data.npz
```

The above commands define a new step in the pipeline that depends on files in `my-data/` directory, and `preprocess.py`; lines that start with `Name:` in `names.txt`; and the first 1000 lines in `a-long-file.csv`. When _any_ of these conditions change, the step command (`python3 preprocess.py`) will run. 

```shell
$ xvc pipeline run --name my-data-update
```

You can define fairly complex dependencies with globs, files, directories, regular expression searches in files, lines in files, other steps and pipelines with `xvc pipeline step dependency` commands. More dependency types like database queries, content from URLs, S3 (or compatible) buckets, Bitcoin (or other) wallets, REST and GraphQL results are in the backlog. 

Please see [docs.xvc.ai] for documentation. 

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This software is fresh and ambitious. Although I use it and test it close to real world conditions, it didn't go under test of time yet. **Xvc can eat your data and spit it to eternal void!**


## üôè Big Thanks

xvc stands on the following (giant) crates: 

- [crossbeam]: I could create decent and clean parallel processors thanks to [crossbeam] channels. 
- [cargo workspaces]: Xvc is split into many crates. I'm able to track crate versions, and bump them with a single command. I'm a much more organized developer thanks to you. 
- [rayon]: Xvc uses parallel iterators from [rayon] to calculate content hashes of millions of files.
- [strum]: I'd lose many hours writing `FromStr` implementations had [strum] wouldn't be. `xvc config` especially thanks to be able to convert strings to typed values. 
- [clap]: Xvc has a deep CLI but all of it are defined and validated with the data structures we use incode, thanks to [clap].
- Xvc uses [rust-s3] to connect to S3 and compatible storage services. 
- Without implementations of BLAKE3, BLAKE2, SHA-2 and SHA-3 from Rust crypto crate, Xvc couldn't track files so fast. 
- [Serde] allows all data structures to be stored in text files. Special thanks from `xvc-ecs` for serializing components in an ECS with a single line of code.
- [reflink], [relative-path], [path-absolutize], [glob] and [wax] for file system and glob handling.
- Thanks to [sad_machine] for providing a State Machine implementation that I used in `xvc pipeline run`. SM made running pipeline steps in parallel with a clean separation of process states. 
- Thanks to [thiserror] and [anyhow] for making error handling a breeze. It's not always a pleasure to handle errors but these two crates make me feel I'm doing something good for the humanity.

And, biggest thanks to Rust designers, developers and contributors. Although I can't see myself expert to appreciate it all, it's a fantastic language and environment to work with. Thanks. 

## Contributing

- Star this repo. I feel very happy for five minutes for every star and send my best wishes to you.
- Really use xvc, tell me how it works for you, ask for documentation, report bugs, dream about features. The greatest contribution might be this now. 
- Write a new test with your workflow to increase testing coverage. They are under `lib/tests/` now but I'm planning to move them to a separate crate. 
- [Be my guest](https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/3595069) when you visit Bursa. I usually don't have time to meet with every guest in person but if you let me know _you_ are coming, I'd like to arrange something. Also, when you visit Galata tower in ƒ∞stanbul, which is close to where I live, you can buy me a coffee. I limit the number of people I meet daily to 5. You can be among that lucky gfive. 
- [Hire me](mailto:jobs@emresult.com). I'm looking for projects that I can use [my expertise in development.](https://emresahin.net/cv/)
