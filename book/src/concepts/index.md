# Concepts

- [Digest](./digest.md): A digest is a 32-byte numeric sequence to identify a file, content or any other data. Xvc uses different algorithms to generate this sequence. 
- [Associated Digest](./associated-digest.md): This is a specific kind of digest associated with an entity. An entity can have more than one digests, like *content digest* or *metadata digest*. Xvc uses these different kinds of digests to avoid unncessary digest calculations.
