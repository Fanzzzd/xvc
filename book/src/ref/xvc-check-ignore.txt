Check whether files are ignored with `.xvcignore`

USAGE:
    xvc check-ignore [OPTIONS] [TARGETS]...

ARGS:
    <TARGETS>...
            Targets to check. If no targets are provided, they are read from stdin

OPTIONS:
    -d, --details
            Show the exclude patterns along with each target path. A series of lines are printed in
            this format: <path/to/.xvcignore>:<line_num>:<pattern> <target_path>

    -h, --help
            Print help information

        --ignore-filename <IGNORE_FILENAME>
            Filename that contains ignore rules
            
            This can be set to .gitignore to test whether Git and Xvc work the same way.
            
            [default: .xvcignore]

    -n, --non-matching
            Include the target paths which donâ€™t match any pattern in the --details list. All
            fields in each line, except for <target_path>, will be empty. Has no effect without
            --details
