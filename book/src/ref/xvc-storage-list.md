# xvc remote list

## Purpose

List all configured remotes with their names and guids. 

## Synopsis 

```text
{{#include xvc-remote-list.txt}}
```

## Examples

List all remotes in the repository:

```shell
$ xvc remote list 
```

## Caveats

This one uses the local configuration and doesn't try to connect remotes.
If it's listed here, it doesn't mean it's guaranteed to work.
